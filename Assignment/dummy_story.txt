Once upon a time, in a far away kingdom there lived a rich man, who had three sons:
Simeon (a soldier), Tarras (a fat man), and Ivan (a fool).
"Although the story is usually considered a children's fairy tale, it is also used as an indication of Tolstoy's political leaning in support of Christianity. Though his borthers are easily tempted by money and military power, unsophisticated Ivan, with his simple way of life, defeats the treacherous devil. Ivan evantually becomes the ruler of the contry despite the lack of a standing army or currency. All of the citizens are welcome at Ivan's table, where workers are fed first and intellectuals have to eat the leftover" <Ref: Wikipedia>
