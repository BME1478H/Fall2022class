Once upon a time, in a far away kingdom there lived a rich man, who had three sons:
Simeon (a soldier), Tarras (a fat man), and Ivan (a fool).
**add a sentence here**
Simeon had been given a magical whip that produced puns every time you cracked it.
Tarras had been given a cookbook that only produced the recipe that you least wanted to eat at that moment.
Ivan had been given the King's darkest secret.
