Once upon a time, in a far away kingdom there lived a rich man, who had three sons:
Simeon (a soldier), Tarras (a fat man), and Ivan (a fool).
**add a sentence here** 
However, Ivan was the only one that was alive at the end. Simeon survived the war but got involved in a flight and dead as he could not control his temper due to PTSD. Tarras received the money. He was too lazy to exercise and he loved eating. Eventually, he died due to overweight. In the end, Ivan got all the money. He knew he was not smart, but he was humble and polite. He was successful as he has helpers and lived happily ever after.
