Once upon a time, in a far away kingdom there lived a rich man, who had three sons:
Simeon (a soldier), Tarras (a fat man), and Ivan (a fool).
The fool, a man of adventerous-nature and a lack of good judgement, eventually made a fortune through bitcoin and lived a long, prosperous life with his beautiful wife and three kids. The fat son, whose humour and wit
eventually saw him at the most sought-after comedy venues in the kingdom, became a celebrity whose fame reached other kingdoms far abroad. Simeon, a soldier, eventually died a penniless man after three divorce settlements and a series of drinking-and-horseback riding charges.
