Once upon a time, in a far away kingdom there lived a rich man, who had three sons:
Simeon (a soldier), Tarras (a fat man), and Ivan (a fool).
The man knew he was going to face a hard time, and tough circumstances, thus he needed to be sure that his sons 
can handle the hardship they were about to face. So, he put his sons to the test for their skills and endurance.
