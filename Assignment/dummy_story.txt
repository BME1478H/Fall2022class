Once upon a time, in a far away kingdom there lived a rich man, who had three sons:
Simeon (a soldier), Tarras (a fat man), and Ivan (a fool).
**add a sentence here**

the devil (being the devil) saw that there were no conflicts between the brothers and thought that this was so boring. So he decided it was time to stir the pot with some trouble and assigned a little devil to each of the brothers. Simeon's devil gave him excessive courage causing him great failures in the battlefield. Tarras' devil gave him excessive greed causing his to spend all of his money on useless things. Finally, Ivan's devil makes him very sick. Seeing all the suffering, the big devil becomes very happy and lived happily every after. The End.
